# LaMetricMinecraft

This script allows you to display the status of the server and the names of the connected players using public apis.
Setup you lametric private app to match the structure of the curl in the script and add you token and url to push at the end of the script.
Once you entered all the missing values (server ip 2x, token and push url) setup the script on your server and add a cron job if you want to run it every X minutes.

Enjoy !
